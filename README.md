# SortSearchStream

### Sort a list of elements, find the average, and search an integer.

* Two options were created to read values, either from file or user input.
Enter ('f') to read from file or ('i') to input values when prompted.

The file option will take the first line is the size of the integer array, the second line is the integer to be searched,
and the third line contains the array elements.

The user input option will take a list of elements separated by spaces.

*A sample file was created to test. Enter 'elements.txt'. Each elements must be separated by spaces. The max number of elements is 50.
After the program reads the elements, it will display the average of those values.*

* Two sort algorithms were created to use.
Enter ('s') for selection sort or ('b') for bubble sort when prompted.

* Two search algorithms were created to use.
Enter ('b') for binary search or ('l') for linear search when prompted.
Then enter the integer to search in the array. The program will display the array position if it exists.
